This project attempts to solve disorganization amongst resellers. Resell portfolio was
intended to make an inventory / profit system to tell the user how much they have
gained or loss based on what they input into the system. A user is supposed to enter an item
in the inventory tab along with all the information about the item such as name, price, and website.
The app will then do a simple algo. to calculate data on whether profit was attained or not, and will
be graphically and textually visualized. I chose to do it in react native because of the previous knowledge of
javascript, and the react framework, as well as the state management system. Project was not finished due to
whole family catching covid since Thanksgiving till 12/6.
